## Dataset format:
There are three CSV files: “train.csv”, “test.csv”, and “sample_submission.csv”. The submission format is provided in “sample_submission.csv”. There are four columns in the dataset:
id_: A unique id for the email.
source: The data source from which the email is extracted.
email: The main email body with the subject line.
class: Indicates whether the email is spam or not.

## Questions:

##### Question 1: Data handling
Question 1.1: Programmatically load the attached data into your favorite analytical tool in Python (you can use Pandas).
Question 1.2: Perform necessary preprocessing to sanitize the data and handle problematic data points.
Question 1.3: Prepare a short EDA report on the dataset (with visualizations).
##### Question 2: Spam detection
Question 2.1: Build an intelligent system to detect spam emails. You can use any approach you prefer. However, we encourage you to focus on simplicity and effectiveness. Provide relevant metrics.
